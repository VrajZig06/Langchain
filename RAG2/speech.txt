Speech on Independence Day

Good morning everyone,

Today, we have gathered here to celebrate the 15th of August, our Independence Day — a day of pride, remembrance, and gratitude. On this day in 1947, India broke free from more than 200 years of British rule and stepped into a new era of freedom. It was not an easy journey. Our freedom fighters — Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Bhagat Singh, Subhas Chandra Bose, and countless others — sacrificed their lives, comfort, and careers so that we could live in an independent nation.

Independence does not only mean the right to govern ourselves; it also means the responsibility to uphold unity, peace, and progress. We must ensure that the values of justice, equality, and liberty are preserved for generations to come.

As we look around, we see a nation that is growing rapidly in science, technology, industry, and culture. Yet, our true success will be measured by how we uplift the poor, educate the young, and preserve the harmony of our diverse society.

Let us pledge today to work honestly and selflessly for our country, so that the dream of our freedom fighters continues to shine forever.

Jai Hind!
