In today's interconnected world, cybersecurity has become a critical component of personal and organizational safety. As more services shift online—banking, education, healthcare, and communication—sensitive data becomes increasingly vulnerable to cyber threats. Cyberattacks such as phishing, ransomware, and data breaches can lead to financial loss, identity theft, and reputational damage.

Organizations invest heavily in firewalls, encryption, and intrusion detection systems to safeguard their networks. However, human error remains one of the biggest vulnerabilities, making user awareness and training essential. Strong password practices, two-factor authentication, and regular software updates are basic yet vital defenses.

Governments and industries around the world are also enacting stricter cybersecurity regulations to protect critical infrastructure and user privacy. As technology continues to evolve, staying informed about cyber risks and practicing digital hygiene is no longer optional—it's a necessity for survival in the digital age.
